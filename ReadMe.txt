Road Map
1. Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Editing in Python
2.Updating data types, removing blank rows and adding new columns with Power BI Transform Data
3.Adding additional columns to the data and editing the data in SQL
4. Establishing a data model with AzureML Studio

Python
Inside the First data folder, there is the initial state of our data. After exploratory data 
analysis and merging the separate tables, I reached the main table on which I will build a 
model in Python. I transferred it to Power BI as an excel file named Export_dataframe.

Power BI
I made the necessary data type changes and simplifications of empty data in Power BI.
I exported it with an excel file.

SQL
After adding and editing a few necessary columns in SQL Server, I exported my data 
file with the Export_fromSQL file.

AzureML
I modeled this data with Poisson Regression and Decision forest Regression in AzureML Studio.
I achieved a success rate of 98 percent.
